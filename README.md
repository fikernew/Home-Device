# 🏠 Smart Home Control System

A Java-based console application that simulates a smart home device management system. Built using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Home Control System allows a user to:
- Log in with a password to access the system
- Select a room and manage its device (Light, Fan, or Air Conditioner)
- Turn devices ON or OFF
- Set a countdown timer for automatic shutoff
- View device status and previous timer configuration in real time

---

## 💡 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | How It's Applied |
|---|---|
| **Abstraction** | `Device` is an abstract class that defines common behavior without full implementation |
| **Inheritance** | `Light`, `Fan`, and `AC` all extend the `Device` class |
| **Encapsulation** | Fields like `status`, `lastTimeConfigured` are private and accessed via getters |
| **Polymorphism** | `getDeviceType()` is overridden in each subclass to return its specific type |

## 🏗️ Class Design

### `Device.java` — Abstract Base Class
- Stores room name, on/off status, timer duration, and start time
- Provides `turnOn()`, `turnOff()`, and `turnOn(int duration)` methods
- Declares abstract method `getDeviceType()` for subclasses to implement

### `Light.java` — Subclasses
- **Light** → controls the room light
- **Fan** → controls the room fan
- **AC** → controls the air conditioner
- All three extend `Device` and override `getDeviceType()`

### `Main.java` — Application Entry Point
- Handles password authentication
- Manages room selection loop with real-time timestamp
- Delegates device control to `manageDevice()` method
